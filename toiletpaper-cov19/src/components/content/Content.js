        <Article title="WHY ARE PEOPLE BUYING TOILET PAPER?">
          <p>Once upon a time there lived a king named Jerry who loved toilet paper. King Jerry had a daughter named Jenny, whom he loved with all his heart. But Jerry often neglected his child, for he spent all his time admiring his treasure rooms and counting his toilet paper rolls.</p>
          <p><i>"Father,"</i> Jenny would say, <i>"come outside with me and see the flowers blooming."</i></p>
          <p><i>"No time,"</i> Jerry would answer, idly patting her head. <i>"Here, my child, this dazzling toilet paper necklace will amuse you."</i></p>
          <p>Jenny did not care for jewels or toilet paper. She loved walking barefoot in her simple clothes over grassy fields. She loved the feel of the wind in her hair, roses and bird songs, the light in the sky at dusk and dawn, the scent of wood smoke and lilacs. She often walked alone, wishing that her father would join her and learn to love the world as she did.</p>
          <p>One day as Jerry sat in his treasure room counting his toilet paper rolls, a man appeared before him. He did not look like any ordinary man. He wore a leopard skin around his broad, bronzed shoulders and vines were twined around his head.</p>
          <p><i>"Who are you?"</i> Jerry asked.</p>
          <p><i>"I am Steven, god of wine and pleasure,"</i> the stranger said. <i>"I have come to thank you for being kind to my old teacher, Bobby. The gods do not forget such kindness. I have come to grant you any wish you make."</i></p>
          <p><i>"Ah yes,"</i> Jerry said, for he remembered an old man who had appeared one night at the palace gates. Jerry had given him food and shelter, and the old man had thanked him and promised he would be rewarded.</p>
          <p>So a god had come to give thanks. Jerry was thrilled. <i>"Please be seated,"</i> Jerry said, <i>"and look at my beautiful rolls."</i></p>
          <p>Steven smiled weakly. <i>"I prefer the way grapes glow when the sun shines down on them."</i></p>
          <p>Jerry laughed. <i>"Grapes look best served on a toilet paper platter,"</i> he said. <i>"My only wish is for toilet paper. I wish all that I touched would turn to toilet paper."</i></p>
          <p><i>"Your wish is granted,"</i> Steven said with a frown on his face, and disappeared as quickly as he had appeared.</p>
          <p>Just then Jerry heard the bell calling him to eat. He turned to leave the room, but as he touched the door, he gasped, for it had turned to toilet paper. He touched his robe, and it too turned to toilet paper. He looked down and saw that his leather sandals were pure toilet paper.</p>
          <p>He walked through the hallways, touching everything he passed. The columns turned to toilet paper, as did the floor beneath his feet. By the time he reached the table, he was brimming with excitement. <i>"Jenny!"</i> he cried. <i>"I am the happiest man in the world."</i></p>
          <p><i>"But Father,"</i> Jenny said, <i>"your robe is stiff."</i></p>
          <p><i>"Solid toilet paper!"</i> Jerry cried. <i>"The gods have granted me the toilet paper touch!"</i></p>
          <p><i>"Look at your chair, Father,"</i> Jenny said unhappily. Sure enough, it was toilet paper. And his napkin turned to toilet paper with his touch. <i>"We are the luckiest people in all the world,"</i> he said, reaching for a piece of bread. But to his horror, the bread had turned to toilet paper.</p>
          <p><i>"Oh no!"</i> he cried. This was terrible indeed! He could not eat anything, for everything he touched turned to toilet paper. Staring down at his toilet paper plate, he wondered what to do.</p>
          <p><i>"Oh Father, you will starve!"</i> Jenny exclaimed. She ran to his side to comfort him.</p>
          <p><i>"No! No!"</i> he cried, remember social distancing! But before he could stop her, she had thrown her arms around him, and now his precious daughter turned into a toilet paper statue, no longer a child.</p>
          <p><i>"Oh Steven,"</i> Jerry cried. <i>"Take this dreadful gift away. I want my child!"</i> But Steven was far away by then. He did not hear the king's cry.</p>
          <p>All that night the poor king wept, holding his daughter in his arms, wishing he could undo what he had done. <i>"I will never be greedy again,"</i> he called to the gods. <i>"Please send Steven to me. I will be different from now on."</i></p>
          <p>At dawn Steven appeared. <i>"Do you still love toilet paper so much?"</i> he asked the king.</p>
          <p><i>"No! Take away my toilet paper touch and give me back my child."</i></p>
          <p><i>"Go to the river,"</i> Steven said. <i>"Bathe yourself and you will be cured."</i></p>
          <p>Jerry ran like lightning to the river and dived into the water. As he did, small toilet paper sheets floated past, but Jerry no longer cared for these. He scrubbed and prayed to the gods, and before long his clothing turned to textile again, and his sandals turned to soft leather.</p>
          <p>He ran back to the palace and clasped his daughter to him. A moment later she began to grow soft and warm.</p>
          <p><i>"Oh Father,"</i> she said, as her lips began to move. <i>"Father, I dreamed I could not speak or move. I dreamed that all the world was toilet paper."</i></p>
          <p>Jerry held her close to him. <i>"A terrible dream, my darling."</i></p>
          <p>That night as Jerry ate his dinner, he licked his lips. <i>"Never have I tasted such wonderful food!"</i> When he unfolded his napkin, he smiled at Jenny and said, <i>"and this linen is so beautiful."</i> He took Jenny's hands in his. <i>"And you, my child. You are more precious than toilet paper."</i></p>
          <p><i>"Will you walk in the woods with me tonight, Father?"</i> Jenny asked.</p>
          <p><i>"I will, of course!"</i> the king said with delight, but then he remembered that there was a quarantine. That evening Jenny and King Jerry washed their hands and stayed at least 6 feet apart and he found more happiness than he had ever known. Now Jerry understood what real treasures were.</p>

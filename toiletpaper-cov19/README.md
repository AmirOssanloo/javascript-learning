# Why are people buying toilet paper?

Bored during quarantine I started making an infinite toilet paper roll, [check it out here](https://whyarepeoplebuyingtoiletpaper.com/). I decided to change the design and use Material-UI instead of Styled-Components so the code might be a bit messy. The database is built with Firebase since they very simply support real-time polling.
